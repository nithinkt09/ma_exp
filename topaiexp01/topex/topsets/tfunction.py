function is a rule of assignment between two sets
f: A -> B is a function that takes every element of A and maps to respective elements in B
all the elements from A are used, however, not every element of B must have respective element in A

f: A -> B; A is the domain and B is the codomain; f(a) = {b: a is in A and b is in B}
f(a) is the image of the function f and is the subset of the set B which is the codomain

key properties: 
    - each element a in A is mapped exactly to one b in B
